            <h2>Common elements</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The various codes of football share certain common elements and can be 
               grouped into two main classes of football: carrying codes like American 
               football, Canadian football, Australian football, rugby union and rugby 
               league, where the ball is moved about the field while being held in the
               hands or thrown, and kicking codes such as association football and 
               Gaelic football, where the ball is moved primarily with the feet,
                and where handling is strictly limited.</p>
            <h2>Etymology</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>There are conflicting explanations of the origin of the word "football".
               It is widely assumed that the word "football" (or the phrase "foot ball")
               refers to the action of the foot kicking a ball.[13] There is an alternative
               explanation, which is that football originally referred to a variety of games
               in medieval Europe that were played on foot.[14] There is no conclusive evidence 
               for either explanation.</p>
